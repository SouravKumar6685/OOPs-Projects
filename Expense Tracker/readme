# Expense Tracker

The Expense Tracker project is designed to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It enables users to track their expenses efficiently by adding, categorizing, and managing them through an intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- **Add Expense**: Record an expense with categories like "Food," "Transport," etc.
- **View Expenses**: Display a list of all expenses or filter them by specific categories or dates.
- **Delete Expense**: Remove incorrect or outdated entries from the expense list.
- **Categorize Expenses**: Group expenses based on predefined categories.
- **Total Spending**: Calculate the total spending over a specific period or within a category.
- **Reports**: Generate summary reports based on daily, monthly, or category-wise expenses.

## OOP Structure

### Class: `Expense`

- **Attributes**: `amount` , `category` , `date` , `description`
  
- **Methods**:
  - `get_details()`: Returns the details of the expense.
  - `edit_expense()`: Allows editing the attributes of the expense.

### Class: `ExpenseTracker`

- **Attributes**: `expenses`.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `add_expense()`: Adds an `Expense` object to the tracker.
  - `view_expenses()`: Views all or filtered expenses by category.
  - `delete_expense()`: Deletes an expense from the list by its index.
  - `get_total_spending()`: Calculates the total spending over a period or within a category.
  - `generate_report()`: Generates a summary report of expenses by category.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create the `Expense` class** with attributes like `amount`, `category`, `date`, and `description`.
2. **Create the `ExpenseTracker` class** to manage expenses, with methods for adding, viewing, and deleting them.
3. **Implement methods** to calculate total spending and generate reports.
4. Optionally, **include file handling** to store and load expenses for future use.
